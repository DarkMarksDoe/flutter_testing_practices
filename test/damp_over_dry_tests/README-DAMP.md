# The "Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases" (DAMP) Principle in Testing

In tests, we can use the **DAMP principle** ("Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases"), which emphasizes readability over uniqueness. Applying this principle can introduce code redundancy (e.g., by repeating similar code), but it makes tests more obviously correct.

## Application in Testing

The DAMP principle encourages testers to prioritize descriptive and meaningful phrases in test cases, even if it means sacrificing some uniqueness or avoiding excessive abstraction. By using clear and expressive language in test names, setup, interactions, and assertions, testers can improve the readability and understandability of the tests, making them easier to maintain and troubleshoot.
