# Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern

Structural approach when realizing tests.

- **Arrange**: Set Up specific conditions for the tests. Could be by creating objects, creating mocks, or any other necessary calls. 
- **Act**: Performs the action that we want to tests. Could be by calling a method, doing process, or an event on a widget. 
- **Assert**: Check the result of the _Action_. Verifying that the result is the expected one.
