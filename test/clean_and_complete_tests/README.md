# Clear and Complete Tests

We as a developer we need to create easily and understandable tests, that are fully self-contained and independent of external factors.
I like to think about understandable, thinking that a developer is just a writer, and other developers people who will read our books.

- **Clarity**: The test name value has to be as descriptive as possible of the behavior itâ€™s testing. 
- **Completeness**: The test must be completed in any situation.
- **Independence**: The test does not rely on any external state.
- **Documentation**: The test has enough documentation to understand what's doing.
- **Failure Message**: The expect assertion is to provide a clear message if the test fails, aiding debugging.
